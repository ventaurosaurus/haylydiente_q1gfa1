    <p>My name is Hayly Venice B. Diente. I am 15 years old. I enjoy reading comics because they give you a way for escape. Escapism can be helpful sometimes since life can be demanding, dull, or just unpleasant at times. One of my favorite heroes of all time is Diana of Themyscira also known as Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman crosses the globe to share her lessons on tolerance and empathy. Her overriding objective is to assist a humanity that is destined to perish. Her empathy is Wonder Woman's real superpower. We can all agree that this kind of bravery is sorely needed in the world today!</p>
